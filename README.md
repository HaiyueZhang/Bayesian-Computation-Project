# Bayesian-Computation-Project

## Research

- Engaged in a comprehensive project aiming to master Bayesian methods for regression models, especially
  when dealing with binary or polytomous outcome variables, or multiple outcome variables in R studio
- Analyzed heart-attack dataset and applied advanced techniques, Cumulative Link Model, Hamiltonian
  Monte Carlo, Horseshoe Prior to establishing Bayesian model and making prediction

## Conclusion

- Bayesian model with horseshoe
  prior performs the best
- 1 (male) is associated with the log
  odds decrease in the outcome by
  1.64 - Female is more likely to get
  heart attack. Typical chest pain
  would have a higher impact on the
  outcome variable compared to
  other type of chest pains.
